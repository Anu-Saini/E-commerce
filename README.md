## Description 
The application provides a solutuion for an ecommerce website to show the backend coding and initiate routing for different endpoints for users. The app uses node.js, express.js , MySql and sequelize to direct users to different pages / data on the site.

## Software Installation
To be able to ruin this code,we need the following dependencies listed in package.json 
    
    dotenv - version 8.2.0,
    express- version 4.17.1,
    mysql2- version 2.1.0 ,
    sequelize- version 5.21.7  

The depandencies can be downloaded via npm package manager using npm Install command.

We need to create an database by loging into mySql using (mysql -u root -p) and typing the password when prompted.

once the database is created, we need to populate the database by creating tables and seeding the tables with data by running the script seeds\index.js using node command.

we use connet to the server via dotenv.

## Using the Application
The application can be used with the help of software Insomnia, which directs us through the different routes and return us the data accordingly.
